## Self Driving Car
Project Autopilot helps in getting the angle of steering rotation in a self-driving car. This project is inspired by <b>NVIDIA End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars</b> and data is gathered from <b>Udacity's Behavioral Cloning repository</b>. It is written in Python and leveraged Keras for Deep Learning functions. 

The End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars research paper can be found in the below table.
This repository uses Convolutional Neural Networks to predict steering angle according to the road.
